# Changelog

## v0.1 — 2026-08-31

Initial public release.

This release was “vibe-coded” with OpenAI Codex under the project owner's direction and testing. Most source code, automated tests, and documentation were generated and revised by Codex. See `AI_DEVELOPMENT.md` for the full disclosure.

- Create, open, edit, validate, and losslessly re-export EDCoPilot time trials.
- Preserve comments, unknown fields, repeated values, section ordering, coordinate precision, encoding, and newline style.
- Capture live latitude, longitude, altitude, heading, body, system, and station context from Elite Dangerous files.
- Create point checkpoints and manually captured gates.
- Calculate gates of a requested physical width from live position, heading, and planetary body radius, either centered on the current position or placed a requested distance ahead.
- Edit start, waypoint, end, travel, speed-warning, restriction, and condition fields used by supplied EDCoPilot examples.
- Save incomplete work in the native `*.edttc.json` project format and create validated `*.export.txt` files for EDCoPilot.
- Package as an unsigned, single-file Windows executable.
